This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Ruby related to directly manipulating instance variables using `instance_variable_set`.  The example shows how bypassing accessor methods can lead to unexpected behavior and undermine the principles of encapsulation.  The solution highlights the preferred method of using accessor methods to maintain data integrity and code predictability.
